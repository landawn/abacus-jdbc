/**
 * Represents the transaction isolation levels supported by JDBC.
 * 
 * <p>Transaction isolation levels define how transactions interact with each other
 * when accessing the same data. Higher isolation levels provide better data consistency
 * but may impact performance due to increased locking.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The isolation levels from least to most restrictive are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #READ_UNCOMMITTED} - Allows dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads</li>
 *   <li>{@link #READ_COMMITTED} - Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads</li>
 *   <li>{@link #REPEATABLE_READ} - Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads</li>
 *   <li>{@link #SERIALIZABLE} - Prevents all phenomena, providing the highest isolation</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Usage example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection();
 * conn.setTransactionIsolation(IsolationLevel.READ_COMMITTED.intValue());
 * 
 * // Or use with a transaction manager
 * IsolationLevel level = IsolationLevel.valueOf(conn.getTransactionIsolation());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see Connection#setTransactionIsolation(int)
 * @see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/transactions.html">JDBC Transactions Tutorial</a>
