/**
 * A read-only interface for handling join entity operations with CRUD DAOs.
 * This interface combines {@link ReadOnlyJoinEntityHelper} and {@link CrudJoinEntityHelper}
 * to provide read-only access to join entity operations for CRUD-based DAOs.
 * 
 * <p>This interface is designed for scenarios where you need to read join entity
 * relationships (such as many-to-many relationships) but should not be able to
 * modify them. All delete operations for join entities are disabled and will
 * throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // For a User-Role many-to-many relationship
 * public interface UserReadOnlyDao extends ReadOnlyCrudJoinEntityHelper<User, Long, SQLBuilder, UserDao> {
 *     // Can load user's roles
 *     List<Role> loadUserRoles(User user) {
 *         return loadJoinEntities(user, Role.class);
 *     }
 *     
 *     // Cannot delete user-role associations
 *     // deleteJoinEntities(user, Role.class) throws UnsupportedOperationException
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @param <T> the type of the entity
 * @param <ID> the type of the entity's identifier
 * @param <SB> the type of SQLBuilder used for query construction
 * @param <TD> the type of the CRUD DAO implementation
 * @see ReadOnlyJoinEntityHelper
 * @see CrudJoinEntityHelper
 * @see CrudDao
