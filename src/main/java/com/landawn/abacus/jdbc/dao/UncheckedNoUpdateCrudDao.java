/**
 * A specialized DAO interface that disables update and delete operations while allowing read and insert operations.
 * This interface is designed for use cases where data modification is restricted to insertions and deletions only,
 * ensuring data integrity by preventing accidental updates. All update-related methods throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * 
 * <p>This interface extends multiple DAO interfaces to provide comprehensive read and delete functionality while
 * blocking update operations. It's particularly useful in audit systems, append-only data stores, or scenarios
 * where historical data must remain immutable.</p>
 * 
 * <p>All methods in this interface throw {@link UncheckedSQLException} instead of checked {@link java.sql.SQLException},
 * allowing for cleaner code without explicit exception handling.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * UncheckedNoUpdateCrudDao<User, Long, SQLBuilder, ?> userDao = daoFactory.createNoUpdateDao(User.class);
 * 
 * // Read operations work normally
 * Optional<User> user = userDao.findById(123L);
 * List<User> activeUsers = userDao.findAll(CF.eq("status", "ACTIVE"));
 * 
 * // Insert operations work normally  
 * User newUser = new User("John", "john@example.com");
 * userDao.insert(newUser);
 * 
 * // Update operations throw UnsupportedOperationException
 * try {
 *     userDao.update(existingUser); // This will throw!
 * } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
 *     // Expected behavior
 * }
 * 
 * // Delete operations work normally
 * userDao.deleteById(123L);
 * }</pre></p>
 *
 * @param <T> The entity type that this DAO manages
 * @param <ID> The type of the entity's primary key (ID)
 * @param <SB> The type of {@link SQLBuilder} used to generate SQL scripts. Must be one of {@code SQLBuilder.PSC}, {@code SQLBuilder.PAC}, or {@code SQLBuilder.PLC}
 * @param <TD> The self-referential type parameter for method chaining in fluent APIs
