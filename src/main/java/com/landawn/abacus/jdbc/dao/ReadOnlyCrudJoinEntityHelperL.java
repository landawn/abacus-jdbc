/**
 * A read-only interface for handling join entity operations with CRUD DAOs that use
 * {@code Long} type primary keys. This interface combines {@link ReadOnlyCrudJoinEntityHelper}
 * and {@link CrudJoinEntityHelperL} to provide read-only access to join entity operations
 * specifically for entities with Long identifiers.
 * 
 * <p>This interface enforces read-only behavior by inheriting from {@link ReadOnlyCrudJoinEntityHelper},
 * which overrides all mutation operations to throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * Only read operations for join entities are available through this interface.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Define a read-only DAO with join entity support
 * public interface UserReadOnlyDao extends ReadOnlyCrudJoinEntityHelperL<User, SQLBuilder, UserDao> {
 *     // Can read join entities (e.g., user roles, permissions)
 *     // Cannot delete join entities
 * }
 * 
 * // Usage:
 * User user = dao.findById(1L);
 * List<Role> roles = dao.loadJoinEntities(user, Role.class); // Works
 * dao.deleteJoinEntities(user, Role.class); // Throws UnsupportedOperationException
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @param <T> the type of the entity
 * @param <SB> the type of SQLBuilder used for query construction
 * @param <TD> the type of the CRUD DAO with Long ID type
 * @see ReadOnlyCrudJoinEntityHelper
 * @see CrudJoinEntityHelperL
 * @see CrudDaoL
