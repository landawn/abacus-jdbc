/**
 * Specifies cascading delete behavior for entity relationships.
 * 
 * <p><strong>DEPRECATED:</strong> This annotation is deprecated and will not be implemented.
 * Cascading delete behavior should be defined and enforced at the database level using
 * foreign key constraints with ON DELETE actions. This provides better data integrity,
 * performance, and consistency across all applications accessing the database.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Instead of using this annotation, define foreign key constraints in your database schema:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * -- SQL example for cascading delete
 * CREATE TABLE orders (
 *     id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
 *     user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
 *     FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
 * );
 * 
 * -- SQL example for restrict delete
 * CREATE TABLE payments (
 *     id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
 *     order_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
 *     FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT
 * );
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>Database-level constraints provide several advantages:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Enforced consistently regardless of application layer</li>
 *   <li>Better performance through database optimization</li>
 *   <li>Works with direct SQL queries and other applications</li>
 *   <li>Prevents orphaned records and maintains referential integrity</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>If you need application-level cascade behavior, implement it explicitly in your DAO methods:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public interface UserDao extends CrudDao<User, Long> {
 *     default void deleteUserWithRelatedData(Long userId) {
 *         // Explicitly delete related data
 *         deleteUserOrders(userId);
 *         deleteUserProfiles(userId);
 *         deleteById(userId);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @deprecated This annotation won't be implemented. Define ON DELETE behavior in database schema instead.
 * @see OnDeleteAction
 * @since 0.8
