/**
 * Represents a database transaction that provides methods for managing transactional operations.
 * This interface abstracts the transaction management layer, allowing for consistent transaction
 * handling across different database implementations.
 * 
 * <p>A transaction follows the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
 * and provides methods to commit or rollback changes made within the transaction scope.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Transaction txn = dataSource.beginTransaction();
 * try {
 *     // Perform database operations
 *     txn.commit();
 * } finally {
 *     txn.rollbackIfNotCommitted();
 * }
