 * Enum representing various database operations that can be performed through AbstractQuery.
 * These operations define how query results are retrieved and processed in the Abacus JDBC framework.
 *

 * allowing the framework to determine the appropriate execution strategy and return type.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?", op = OP.list)
 * List<User> findUsersByAge(int age);
 * 
 * @Query(value = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users", op = OP.queryForSingle)
