/**
 * Enumeration that represents transaction propagation behaviors.
 * 
 * <p>Transaction propagation defines how methods should behave when called within 
 * the context of an existing transaction. These behaviors determine whether a new 
 * transaction should be created, whether the current transaction should be suspended,
 * or whether the method should participate in the existing transaction.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This enum is commonly used with the {@code @Transactional} annotation to specify
 * how transaction boundaries should be managed for specific methods or classes.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Transaction propagation behaviors from most to least permissive:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #SUPPORTS} - Works with or without a transaction</li>
 *   <li>{@link #REQUIRED} - Requires a transaction, creates one if needed</li>
 *   <li>{@link #MANDATORY} - Requires an existing transaction</li>
 *   <li>{@link #REQUIRES_NEW} - Always creates a new transaction</li>
 *   <li>{@link #NOT_SUPPORTED} - Never runs in a transaction</li>
 *   <li>{@link #NEVER} - Fails if a transaction exists</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Usage example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
 * public void auditOperation() {
 *     // This method always runs in its own transaction
 * }
 * 
 * @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.MANDATORY)
 * public void criticalOperation() {
 *     // This method requires an existing transaction
 * }
 * }</pre>

     * that the method executes in complete isolation from any outer transaction.</p>
